      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I am currently a freshman here at <strong>Mizzou</strong>. I started off as <strong>Business</strong> major while also exploring other fields such as IT and computer science. Hence the reason I am taking this class. I’ve come to the conclusion that I ultimately want to do Health professions- emphasis <strong>sonography</strong>. I may have a change of heart and also do computer science one day. But overalL I'm glad I took this class.</p>
      <p>I would say my first year of college has been eventful and a learning experience. Some of the cons of this year would have to be how poor I am at time management. It’s been a battle managing social life, school life, personal life and job life. I feel like there's just not enough time in the day to do everything. Second, I would say is the unsureness of my major has made me feel pretty <em>unconfident</em> and <em>low</em>. But I realized it is not a decision you make overnight. I’m glad I took this class because its made me question if I actually coding and is this something I could do long term.</p>
      <h2>Favorite Parts of College Life</h2>
      <p>My favorite parts of this year so far have been making new friends, joining clubs such as African student association. I like that there is always something to do on campus, it's never boring. It's starting to feel more like my second home. I enjoy the student life and the independence of college. I also love our school spirit. I'd say my favorite area of school is the student center because it's the most liveliest place. Overall I am pretty glad with my decision at Mizzou so far!</p>
